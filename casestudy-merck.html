                <span class="projectDetailsSmall"><span class="intro">Illustration</span> / 2019 / Illustrator, Photoshop, Acrobat, Sketch</span>

            <p><span class="intro">Merck Millipore is an international company</span> specializing in the sale of life science manufacturing equipment. They needed a Sales Application that would streamline the purchasing process for their employees and consumers. I helped bring this application to life by designing a series of illustrations displaying biomanufacturing processes and products.</p>

    <h2>Process and Wireframes</h2>
            <p>The process initiated with close collaboration with Milliporeâ€™s science teams. Rough outlines of the processes to be illustrated were delivered by Millipore and then converted into blueprints displaying the products, their connections, their names, and general scale and appearance.</p>

            <p>With these outlines, the experts at Millipore were able to verify the accuracy of the processes and our team at Maark was able to further familiarize ourselves with the product and utilize a jumping-off point for more complex illustrations.</p>

        <h3>The Wireframe Workflow:</h3>
            <figure>
                <img alt"Illustration of a wireframe" src="i/wireframe-01.png">
                <figcaption>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The PPT is received.</li>
                        <li>The PPT is converted into blueprints. Connections between products are clearly illustrated. Products that will appear are labeled.</li>
                        <li>PDFs are submitted for review and approved.</li>
                    </ol>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <p>I collaborated with my team members at Maark to create a system of visual design for the project. The choice was made to display the products in the form of illustrations to highlight the products. The illustrations were initially black and white, but the move was eventually made to transition them into color to highlight the individual products and add vibrancy to the individual elements. </p>
        
        <h3>Illustration process:</h3>
            <figure>
                    <img alt="An example of the illustration visual design" src="i/illustration-01.png">
                    <figcaption>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The illustrations were drawn in adobe illustrator, based on approved blueprints.</li>
                            <li>Final processing was added in Adobe Photoshop.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

     <h2>Technical Design</h2>
            <p>The scope of the illustrations was initially very small, thus the illustrations were static. Continuing success with the project prompted Millipore to expand the scope of the program to encompass even more products and processes, which resulted in additional challenges.</p>

                    <td>Modular steps were separated into individual files, by process type and stage. These could easily be combined, edited and labeled in less resource-intensive photoshop files.</td>

                    <td>The previous naming scheme was adapted to accommodate the additional graphics. The now defunct plugin slicy was used to easily export photoshop artboards quickly, at consistent names and sizes. </td>
                </tr>
